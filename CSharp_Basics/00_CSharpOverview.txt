	.Net framework:-
	 .net framework allow you write following application.
	  ==> window application
	  ==> web application
	  ==> web services.

	  .net frame work application are multi platform application
	  
       The .Net framework applications are multi-platform applications. 
	   The framework has been designed in such a way that it can be used from any of the following languages:
	   C#, C++, Visual Basic, Jscript, COBOL, etc.
	   All these languages can access the framework as well as communicate with each other.

	   Following are some of the components of the .Net framework −

			Common Language Runtime (CLR)
			The .Net Framework Class Library
			Common Language Specification
			Common Type System
			Metadata and Assemblies
			Windows Forms
			ASP.Net and ASP.Net AJAX
			ADO.Net
			Windows Workflow Foundation (WF)
			Windows Presentation Foundation
			Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)

	 Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C#
     Microsoft provides the following development tools for C# programming −

		Visual Studio 2010 (VS)
		Visual C# 2010 Express (VCE)
		Visual Web Developer


	 Writing C# Programs on Linux or Mac OS
	 Although the.NET Framework runs on the Windows operating system, there are some alternative versions 
	 that work on other operating systems.
	 Mono is an open-source version of the .NET Framework which includes a C# compiler 
	 and runs on several operating systems, including various flavors of Linux and Mac OS. Kindly check Go Mono.

	 The stated purpose of Mono is not only to be able to run Microsoft .NET applications cross-platform,
	 but also to bring better development tools for Linux developers.
	 Mono can be run on many operating systems including Android, BSD, iOS, Linux, OS X, Windows, Solaris, and UNIX
